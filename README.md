# List of my stupid coding mistakes

While you are coding you inevitably make some stupid typos that can stop you're work at hours or days. Some kind of errors can freeze all project for months or more. And after a long time when you finally want to lookup what are you coding you just make a hole in your head via your facepalm. I want to share my shame for laughing, collect more experience for others and remind yourself that big problem consist in few little things.
